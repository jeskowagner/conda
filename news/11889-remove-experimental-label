### Deprecations

* `context.experimental_solver` is now marked for pending deprecation.
  It is replaced by `context.solver`. The same applies to the `--experimental-solver` flag,
  the `CONDA_EXPERIMENTAL_SOLVER` environment variable, and the `ExperimentalSolverChoice` enum,
  which will be replaced by `--solver`, `EXPERIMENTAL_SOLVER` and `SolverChoice`, respectively.
